      <strong>petakopi</strong> is an answer for coffee lovers looking for a
      new place to have coffee. We don't intend it to be another Google Place,
      Foursquare, Instagram or others. We just want to find a place to have a
      good coffee for now.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-2">
      That being said, we are still open to the idea of helping the community.
      But time is limited so, new features will be added slowly, like a
      dripping coffee from a V60.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-2">

    <p class="mt-4">
      It has come to our attention that people ask us the actual purpose of the
      "Muslim Owner" tag.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      In Islam, the food and drinks consumed has to meet certain requirements
      such as no alcohols, animals are slaughtered according to Islam method and
      no prohibited animals products such as pork. Food and drinks meeting this
      requirement are deemed Halal.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      It is pretty standard for a cafe/stall to serve both coffee and food.
      Coffee or drinks are usually fine and is usually the food itself that has
      much more criteria to meet.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      It is common to assume "Muslim Owner" will use halal ingredients and
      doesn't serve pork/alcohol in their food and drinks, hence other Muslim
      can decide if they could consume the food there.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      We also realized that there are non-muslim coffee places that serve halal
      foods with no alcohol or pork on the premises. It is beneficial to know
      that information for the customer to decide.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      We tried to provide as much information as we could, but in the end, it
      is up to you to use that information or not. Some people think it is
      necessary, and some don't.
